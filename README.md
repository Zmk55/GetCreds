Powershell Script to Email WiFi Credentials

Just download the .bat file and run it! 

Note: You need to edit the .ps1 script and add your own email address for $Email and add the email password (or app password) for the ConverTo-SecureString "Email Password"

The .bat file will download the PS script and execute it. The PS script will gather wifi credentials as .xml files and put them in a folder.  Next it will add them as an attachment and email them to you. After it is done it will delete all of the folders and files created!
